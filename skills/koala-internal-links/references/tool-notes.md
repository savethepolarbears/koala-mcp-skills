# Tool notes — Internal-link opportunity map

Reviewed 2026-10-01. Runtime definitions win. These are conservative transcriptions; inspect exact live inputs, especially opaque fields. Costs are reviewed planning estimates, not a real-time billing guarantee. Full workflows may use a subset of the tools listed.

## `get_usage`

Effect: `read`. Scope: `account`. Cost: `{"kind": "free"}`.

Required fields: none exposed.

Exposed fields: none; call without arguments.

Check platform credits and writer words separately. Reading a balance does not reserve it.

## `get_sitemap`

Effect: `read`. Scope: `public`. Cost: `{"credits": "0.25", "kind": "fixed"}`.

Required fields: `domain`.

Exposed fields: `domain`, `limit`.

Default 1,000, up to 50,000 slugs; 90-second/200-child bounds. returnedSlugCount is returned inventory, not site total. No proof of indexation or orphan status.

## `get_page_content`

Effect: `read`. Scope: `public`. Cost: `{"credits": "0.25", "kind": "fixed"}`.

Required fields: `url`.

Exposed fields: `offset`, `contentHash`, `url`.

Up to 100,000 characters per returned chunk. Continue with returned nextOffset and same contentHash; every chunk costs credits. Changed hash requires restart. Extracted text can omit important markup; not finding a fact does not prove absence.

## `get_gsc_top_pages`

Effect: `read`. Scope: `brand`. Cost: `{"kind": "free"}`.

Required fields: none exposed.

Exposed fields: `days`, `startDate`, `endDate`, `country`, `device`, `pageContains`, `queryContains`, `limit`, `brandId`.

Measured connected-property data. Explicit inclusive date pairs; equal periods and same filters. GSC country filters use alpha-3. Missing or truncated rows are not zero. compare=true is supported only on aggregate search performance.

## `get_gsc_page_performance`

Effect: `read`. Scope: `brand`. Cost: `{"kind": "free"}`.

Required fields: `pageUrl`.

Exposed fields: `days`, `startDate`, `endDate`, `pageUrl`, `limit`, `brandId`.

Measured connected-property data. Explicit inclusive date pairs; equal periods and same filters. GSC country filters use alpha-3. Missing or truncated rows are not zero. compare=true is supported only on aggregate search performance.

## `check_keyword_coverage`

Effect: `read`. Scope: `public`. Cost: `{"credits": "3", "kind": "fixed"}`.

Required fields: `keywords`, `domain`.

Exposed fields: `keywords`, `domain`, `country`, `language`.

Max 30. Model judgments from sitemap/ranking evidence; not planned tasks and not proof of absence. Inspect matched URL and intent before replacement.
