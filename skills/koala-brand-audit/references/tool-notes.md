# Tool notes — Brand context and knowledge audit

Reviewed 2026-10-01. Runtime definitions win. These are conservative transcriptions; inspect exact live inputs, especially opaque fields. Costs are reviewed planning estimates, not a real-time billing guarantee. Full workflows may use a subset of the tools listed.

## `list_brands`

Effect: `read`. Scope: `account`. Cost: `{"kind": "free"}`.

Required fields: none exposed.

Exposed fields: none; call without arguments.

Resolve the brand deliberately. Do not copy account results into the public repository.

## `get_brand_profile`

Effect: `read`. Scope: `brand`. Cost: `{"kind": "free"}`.

Required fields: none exposed.

Exposed fields: `brandId`.

Inspect integration and effective post status before generation; presets or project overrides can change them.

## `get_brand_knowledge`

Effect: `read`. Scope: `brand`. Cost: `{"kind": "free"}`.

Required fields: none exposed.

Exposed fields: `brandId`.

Saved business facts are context, not independent verification of every claim. No knowledge-update tool is exposed.

## `list_writer_presets`

Effect: `read`. Scope: `brand`. Cost: `{"kind": "free"}`.

Required fields: none exposed.

Exposed fields: `brandId`.

Named preset settings replace defaults as a snapshot, not a shallow overlay. Use exact discovered names only.

## `list_article_tasks`

Effect: `read`. Scope: `brand`. Cost: `{"kind": "free"}`.

Required fields: none exposed.

Exposed fields: `status`, `startDate`, `endDate`, `dateScope`, `sortBy`, `limit`, `initiativeId`, `brandId`.

One status array is preferable to repeated one-status calls. Calendar coverage is separate from published coverage.

## `get_page_content`

Effect: `read`. Scope: `public`. Cost: `{"credits": "0.25", "kind": "fixed"}`.

Required fields: `url`.

Exposed fields: `offset`, `contentHash`, `url`.

Up to 100,000 characters per returned chunk. Continue with returned nextOffset and same contentHash; every chunk costs credits. Changed hash requires restart. Extracted text can omit important markup; not finding a fact does not prove absence.
